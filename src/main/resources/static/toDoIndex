INDEX:
    - home page
    - link to customers page

CUSTOMERS PAGE:
    - shows all customers by id
    - id is a link to "drill down" to view an individual customer (viewCustomer page)
    - has a link to the add customer page

ADD CUSTOMER PAGE:
    - shows the fields in a form with an ADD button to submit the form
    - after adding, shows customers page

The controller will use the '@Autowired CustomerService' reference (eg: the route that returns the page that shows all customers will call the method on 'CustomerService' to get all the list of customers and add the list to the model).
